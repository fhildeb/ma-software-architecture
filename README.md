## Course Contents

This repo features projects from a course about Architecture of Complex Software Systems. The course focused on understanding software architecture, design patterns, and best practices. It laid out the benefit and needs of software architecture, and architects, as well as explaining key terms and concepts. The course covered design, documentation, and evaluation of software architectures, along with architecture styles and model-driven software development. General procedures for producing software on an architecture blueprint were discussed, as well as programming templates and design principles. Architectural styles such as batch-sequential, pipes and filters, layers, ports and adapters, repositories, blackboards, object orientation, and more were covered in depth.

### Core Features

- Design Patterns (GoF)
- Java Programming Examples
- Software Architect's Role and Tasks
- Design and Documentation of Software Architectures
- Architecture Styles & Patterns
- Evaluation of Software Architectures (ATAM)
- Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD)
- General Procedure for Software Architecture Production
- Solution Templates and Design Principles

## Repository Contents

Throughout the course, Docker and Docker Compose were taught to create and manage containers, streamlining the development process and ensuring consistency across environments. MongoDB was introduced as a flexible NoSQL database, while NodeJS and ExpressJS were utilized to build a scalable and efficient backend.

There were a number of practical applications that fell into two categories: 8 programms applying various pattern techniques in Java and a separate web app combining patterns with a backend and a VueJS application written in TypeScript.

### Pattern Techniques

1. Singleton, Observer, Adapter Patterns
2. Composite Pattern Tree Structures
